What the DAQ needs before real data taking
==========================================

In no particluar order, these are things that will be show-stoppers for taking Soudan data.

 1. a way to derive trigger times from more precise hardware clock sources
 2. external non-DCRC triggering protocols

Here is a list of other things that we could live without, but shouldn't

 1. not to hard-code a number of channels/DCRC
 2. abstraction of DCRC reg map
