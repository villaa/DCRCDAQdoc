DCRC Detector Tools SQUID Tuning GUI
====================================

Had a nice deomonstration of the SQUID tuning GUI tool from Bruno and Berkeley people.  I want to
get the code (actually got it at `~/MidasDTC.tar.gz` for now) and start using it on our SQUIDS. 

Follow-up on Processing: The Quick Route
========================================

So I started doing an overhaul of the processing pipeline yesterday and this is currently stored
at `~/k100Pipe`, but I decided that we need to get some of the processing working super fast, so
I've turned my attention to getting the cdmsbats installed and getting some quick scripts running
to extract the filter files and basic processings of the initial data we've taken.  Also, there
have been some snags in smooth data taking so there is some time to work on this now as the data
comes in slowly. 

`cdmsbats` has just been moved over to git and is available from [cdms gitblit](http://titus.stanford.edu:8080/git/repositories/).
They have done a submodule for `BatCommon` so I have to check that the tags line up. 

Checkout of cdmsbats Using Submodules
=====================================

In the directory `/data/chocula/processingCode/` I've checked out cdmsbats to use it is currently
checked out as cdmsbats_Prod in that directory using:

```
$git clone cdmsonly@nero.stanford.edu:/data/git/Reconstruction/cdmsbats cdmsbats_Prod
```

We will use the tags internal to this directory and a top-level script to make our system aware of
this installation and what tagged version it represents. 

Note that this repository is checked out as cdmsonly, this is so that people can pull new
versions.  If there is development going on I would expect it can be done with personal checkouts.
The expectation is that the `k100Pipe` package can easily accomodate different "installs" of
cdmsbats for testing.  For each case the specific version (Tag and/or Commit) of cdmsbats should
be tracked by separating the processed files.  A simple way to do this might be to put the
processed data with this version in a directory called TAG_partialhash.

Actually the above didn't do the right thing wrt the submodule automatically.  I had to do the
following to get it to really work:

```
$git clone cdmsonly@nero.stanford.edu:/data/git/Reconstruction/cdmsbats cdmsbats_Prod

$git submodule status
```

The first thing clones the superrepo and the next thing lists the submodules (should list
BatCommon only). 

```
$git submodule init
```

At this point it put the remote into the superrepo's `.git/config` file as:

```
[submodule "BatCommon"]
	url = nero:/data/git/Reconstruction/BatCommon.git
```

That, of course, wouldn't work so I changed it **by hand** to:

```
[submodule "BatCommon"]
	url = cdmsonly@nero.stanford.edu:/data/git/Reconstruction/BatCommon.git
```

After that I did:

```
$git config -l

$git submodule update
```

Finally to get the tag `TF_v0-1` I had to do:

```
$git checkout -b TF_v0-1_branch TF_v0-1
```

In **both** the superrepo directory and the submodule directory.
