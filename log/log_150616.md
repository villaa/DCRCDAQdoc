Script for settings file in LabView DAQ
=======================================

The .xml files used for the LabView DAQ can be manipulated in text and used to do scanning runs.
We wanted to scan over the SQUID offsets yesterday to lock at different places on the modulation
curve.  I made some scripts and put them in these notes to do this. 

![DAQDAQ2.awk](scripts/DAQDAQ2.awk)

![DAQDAQ2.sh](scripts/DAQDAQ2.sh)

The usage of these goes like `$DAQDAQ2.sh del1 del2 del3 nominal_file`.  It automatically scans
from `-3\*del` to `3\*del` for each parameter.  The different del parameters get applied to the
different DCRC channels.  `del1` is applied to the first 4 channels, `del2` the next 4, etc. 

Setting up Triggering for the MIDAS DAQ
=======================================

Ok, it might be time to try some real data taking with the MIDAS DAQ in the current run K100.  We
can communicate between MIDAS and the DCRCs and the settings seem to be passing correctly.  So can
we take real data, with real randoms etc., and process it properly? 

One of the things I know is that the program `triggerfe2.exe` in the MIDAS DAQ package is
responsible in some general way for trigger settings or getting triggers.  I also know this has to
run as a daemon in Linux (in the background) and is envoked like:

```
$triggerfe3.exe -D
```

See the notes in my DCRCDAQdoc log `log_150512.md`.  Since this is clearly running as a daemon,
I'd like to learn more about it's execution and operation.  For example it's clear that this
program doesn't even have a `main()` function.  To help me understand this I looked up some daemon
refs:

Load new DCRC Firmware for RevC.1
=================================

Some links for changing to a new firmware version:

Jianjie also cooked up some instructions for this here:

`time 15:42`

This actually took a lot longer than I'd hoped, but I now understand the process much better.  I
first tried to do this on a strictly unix platform without the drivers that are mentioned in the
above links or anything.  This failed.  I think it just can't work through TCP/IP, I'll go over
how I first tried it there, then got it to work in windows, then tried again through TCP/IP and
failed. 

Trying Through TCP/IP
---------------------

The basic procedure (see links above) is to connect to the DCRC, issue the FR command (and record
the hex checksum for the firmware we have). Then issue the FL command to erase the firmware.
Finally (this is the tricky part) wait the "appropriate" amount of time and then send the new file
data to the DCRC.  I did this through TCP/IP by connecting through a normal telnet session to DCRC
50 (`131.225.52.181`) and issuing the FL command.  Nothing came back but I still tried to stream
the new firmware file to it via TCP/IP to the same port I was connecting to it through telnet with
(in retrospect maybe *this* was the problem).

```
$cat RevC_1_FPGA.rbf |nc -i 2 131.225.52.85 5000
```

Note: `nc` is the "netcat" command and is a good way to send arbitrary data to various hosts and
ports with the TCP/IP protocol.  I will write this in my unix notes.   Anyway this resulted in the
hex value checksum being stored as `0x4528`, but the other checksum that should match was
`0x0000`, so it seemed something was wrong.  And when we tried the board it was indeed incorrect.
I think the firmware is not setable from the TCP/IP connection.

Trying Through Windows
----------------------

On Windows the basic procedure is the same except we use a COM (serial) port connection to the
board through the USB.  You have to find the COM device in the Windows device manager.  Then use a
program (I was successful with MTTY) to connect to that COM port, and issue the above commands.
The tricky part was that after the FL command, the DCRC goes through some lines of hex values that
it's erasing (I guess).  Then there is a blank line and it pauses.  If you wait long enough it
says that the board is "ready" to load new firmware or something.  Often times (but not always)
I've found that this is too long to wait and we've already missed our window for streaming the
file.  So the file can be streamed right after the last line in the FL hex erasing stuff.  If it's
done successfully hex lines will scroll as the new file is written and at the end the checksums
will come back and the stored and current checksums will match. 

I've done this for DCRC 50 and DCRC X to fix the charge readback problem.  Here is a table of
their checksums before and after. 

|DCRC | Previous Checksum | Current Checksum|
---------------------------------------------
|50| `0x6E53` | `0x45AD` |
|X| `0xC7C1` | `0x45AD` |
