Script for settings file in LabView DAQ
=======================================

The .xml files used for the LabView DAQ can be manipulated in text and used to do scanning runs.
We wanted to scan over the SQUID offsets yesterday to lock at different places on the modulation
curve.  I made some scripts and put them in these notes to do this. 

![DAQDAQ2.awk](scripts/DAQDAQ2.awk)

![DAQDAQ2.sh](scripts/DAQDAQ2.sh)

The usage of these goes like `$DAQDAQ2.sh del1 del2 del3 nominal_file`.  It automatically scans
from `-3\*del` to `3\*del` for each parameter.  The different del parameters get applied to the
different DCRC channels.  `del1` is applied to the first 4 channels, `del2` the next 4, etc. 

Setting up Triggering for the MIDAS DAQ
=======================================

Ok, it might be time to try some real data taking with the MIDAS DAQ in the current run K100.  We
can communicate between MIDAS and the DCRCs and the settings seem to be passing correctly.  So can
we take real data, with real randoms etc., and process it properly? 

Load new DCRC Firmware for RevC.1
