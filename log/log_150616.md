Script for settings file in LabView DAQ
=======================================

The .xml files used for the LabView DAQ can be manipulated in text and used to do scanning runs.
We wanted to scan over the SQUID offsets yesterday to lock at different places on the modulation
curve.  I made some scripts and put them in these notes to do this.
