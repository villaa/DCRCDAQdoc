Setting up Midas again (again)
=============================

Setup the new ODB (again, annoying! and poorly documented)
----------------------------------------------------------

So we are following (again) the file `documentation/triumf_dcrc_installation.txt` in the MidasDAQ repo.

I didn't do the executables or change the exptab file this time, because those are things I
understand, I want to pay particular attention to creating the ODB this time. 

First we need to remove the .ODB.SHM (moved it to .ODB.SHM.old.20150908).  This
will be in the Midas experimental directory as set by `exptab` (I guess).  Then set up a new blank
ODB with the right size:

```
odbedit -s 4194304
```

Got this error, and the instructions say that it's "normal: (but, see *comment A* below)"

```
[ODBEdit,ERROR] [system.c:1021:ss_shm_delete,ERROR] shm_unlink(/cdms_UMN_ODB_SHM) errno 2 (No such file or directory)
```

I then ran midas by using my startup script in `online/bin` directory of the repo the script is
committed to git and is called `start_daq_umn.sh`, it makes some assumptions, so have a look at it
before blindly using it.

After starting, I see that the `mlogger` is running even though in the instructions it says that
this requires the `Equipment/` directory in the ODB tree, which I don't have yet. 

*comment A* It's also interesting to note that the error I got was on the `odbedit -s 4194304`
command, *not* upon starting up the system.  The instructions say we should expect this error
(perhaps appearing twice) on startup of the system.  On my startup above I got no errors and
things appear fine. 

I then killed the running processes: mhttpd, mserver, mlogger.

When trying to run the command `odbedit -c clean` as the instructions request I get:

```
[ODBEdit,INFO] Client 'Logger' on buffer 'SYSMSG' removed by bm_open_buffer because process pid 27775 does not exist
```

but on a second invocation I don't get this error.  Nevertheless the `odbedit -c clean` command
*does not* drop me into an odbedit session. 

Then add new key to the ODB:

```
jiajin:online cdmssoft$odbedit
[local:cdms_UMN:S]/>create DWORD /Experiment/MAX_EVENT_SIZE
[local:cdms_UMN:S]/>set /Experiment/MAX_EVENT_SIZE 25600000
```

Note that you need quotes when the variables have spaces in them, and that inside the odbedit
environment you can list directories and use tab-completion to see what you're doing.  Then I did:

```
[local:cdms_UMN:S]/>create DWORD "/Experiment/Buffer sizes/SYSTEM"
[local:cdms_UMN:S]/>set "/Experiment/Buffer sizes/SYSTEM" 256000000
```

I then removed the "SYSTEM" files as instructed, *what is this for?*

```
jiajin:online cdmssoft$rm .SYSTEM.SHM 
jiajin:online cdmssoft$rm /dev/shm/*_SYSTEM_SHM
```

Now I got the "normal" error message:

```
jiajin:bin cdmssoft$./start_daq_umn.sh 
Good, we are on jiajin!
[ODBEdit,ERROR] [system.c:1021:ss_shm_delete,ERROR] shm_unlink(/cdms_UMN_SYSTEM_SHM) errno 2 (No
such file or directory)
Becoming a daemon...
mserver started interactively
Becoming a daemon...
Becoming a daemon...
```

I found the main() function!
-----------------------------

Now, I've found that the `main()` function that I've been looking for is included from the file:

```
/local/cdms/MidasDAQ/packages/midas/linux/lib/mfe.o
```

Specifically, included from the source code here:

```
/local/cdms/MidasDAQ/packages/midas/src/mfe.c 
```

I found that the call gives first control to the user functions is in line 2786:

```
2779    /* switch off interrupts and detach */
2780    if (interrupt_eq) {
2781       interrupt_configure(CMD_INTERRUPT_DISABLE, 0, 0);
2782       interrupt_configure(CMD_INTERRUPT_DETACH, 0, 0);
2783    }
2784 
2785    /* call user exit function */
2786    frontend_exit();
2787 
2788    /* close slow control drivers */
2789    for (i = 0; equipment[i].name[0]; i++)
2790       if ((equipment[i].info.eq_type & EQ_SLOW) && equipment[i].status == FE_SUCCESS) {
2791 
```

In the user code `dcrc_driver.c` a call is made to `check_odb_structure()` is used to create DCRC
keys if they do not exist. Basically that function uses the MIDAS call to the functions
`odbRead*()`.

```
492 /*-- Frontend Init -------------------------------------------------*/
493 // Upon init, read ODB settings and write them to DCRC
494 INT frontend_init()
495 {
496   printf ("Starting front end\n");
497 
498   // Determine which tower we will talk to. If none specified, default to 1
499   whichtower = frontend_index;
500   if (whichtower < 0) whichtower = 1;
501 
502   //this function runs to odbRead* function for every ODB variable that should exist for a given DCRC.
503   //we don't use any of the variables readout through these functions, but we use the functionality
504   //of the odbRead* functions, which will create a variable in the ODB if it doesn't already exist
505   //and also creates the variable with a some default value.
506  for(int dcrc = 1; dcrc <= 6; dcrc++){
507    //we pass in the third argument a 1 or a 2.  1 means check the
508    //odb structure of the actual odb (\Equipment\Tower01\Settings)
509    //while two means check the structure of the 'mirror' odb which
510    //will only be written to be the dcrc_driver and will store
511    //only the settings that we know have been written to the dcrc
512    check_odb_structure(dcrc, whichtower, 1);
513    check_odb_structure(dcrc, whichtower, 2);
514  }
515 
```

In the `dcrc_driver.c` we also have the statement:

```
119 extern INT frontend_index;
```

This variable is carried over from the MIDAS side via an `extern` declaration (gasp!) is input
into the `main()` function via the code near this set of lines:

```
2585             printf
2586                 ("usage: frontend [-h Hostname] [-e Experiment] [-d] [-D] [-O] [-i n]\n");
2587             printf("         [-d]     Used to debug the frontend\n");
2588             printf("         [-D]     Become a daemon\n");
2589             printf("         [-O]     Become a daemon but keep stdout\n");
2590             printf("         [-i n]   Set frontend index (used for event building)\n");
2591             return 0;
```

This shows what's happening when we use the `-i n` option.

Run programs to set up ODB and continue
--------------------------------------

I got this email from Scott for the order of the programs that need to be executed.

```
Hi Anthony.Â  I believe that the programs should be started in this order:
 1. dcrc_driver.exe
 2. towerfe3.exe
 3. triggerfe2.exe
Cheers,
Scott
```

So, I see that executing `dcrc_driver.exe -i 1` runs, and does indeed seem to create the ODB for
just the Tower 1.

The program is running and I get a lot of errors like:

```
[dcrc_driver01,ERROR] [utils1.cxx:25:dcrc_driver,ERROR] Array '/Equipment/Tower01/Settings/DCRC4/Trigger/ChargeTriggerThreshold' isn't large enough, so attempting to resize
[dcrc_driver01,INFO] Resizing '/Equipment/Tower01/Settings/DCRC4/Trigger/ChargeTriggerThreshold'[2] of type 7, old size 1
```

But I assume this is only because many variables don't exist, and they need to be created.   I
note that the program moves *very* slowly, I don't fully understand why this is. 

Tried running the program `towerfe3.exe -i 1`, this ran for a moment and then quit. It's possible
it quit because the trigger program was not running.   

I noticed also that everything that has a subtree under `/Equipment/` will have a display on the
front page.  Whether this display is red or green seems to depend on the
`/Equipment/NAME/Common/Status` variable.  For the `dcrc_driver01` which is (apparently) created
when envoking `dcrc_driver.exe -i 1` command, this variable is set to
`dcrc_driver01@jiajin.spa.umn.edu`.  My hypothesis is that this variable is used by the MIDAS code
somehow to check on the running (or not running) of this process.  This would mean that the name
`dcrc_driver01` needs to be associated to some process ID presumably, that can be checked by MIDAS
(because the process name *is not* `dcrc_driver01`, it's `dcrc_driver.exe`).

Indeed I see in the code `dcrc_driver.exe` I see the following:

```
149 /*-- Equipment list ------------------------------------------------*/
150 
151 #undef USE_INT
152 
153 EQUIPMENT equipment[] = {
154 
155    {"dcrc_driver%02d",               /* equipment name */
156     {3, 0,                   /* event ID, trigger mask */
157      "SYSTEM",               /* event buffer */
158 #ifdef USE_INT
159      EQ_INTERRUPT,           /* equipment type */
160 #else
161      EQ_PERIODIC|EQ_INTERRUPT,              /* equipment type */
162 #endif
163      LAM_SOURCE(0, 0xFFFFFF),        /* event source crate 0, all stations */
164      "MIDAS",                /* format */
165      TRUE,                   /* enabled */
166      RO_RUNNING,           /* read only when running */
167      200,                    /* poll for 200ms */
168      0,                      /* stop run after this event limit */
169      0,                      /* number of sub events */
170      0,                      /* don't log history */
171      "", "", "",},
172     driver_event,      /* readout routine */
173     },
174 
175    {""}
176 };
177 #ifdef __cplusplus
178 }
179 #endif
```

This seems to be a global in that code.  Somehow the code must inform `mhttpd` that it's running
at some interval, communicating the equipment name each time, that code is probably upstream in
MIDAS, which is why this equipment variable is global (bleh!).
