MIDAS change for Binding RPC to localhost
=========================================

It seems that when we updated the MIDAS source code there was a subtle change in the upstream
code that got propagated and caused some as-yet-unseen behavior.  

The behavior was that all frontends ran as `localhost` in the sense that their frontends were
reporting `frontend@localhost`.  While I don't know what this means I did know that before they
were reporting `frontend@jiajin.spa.umn.edu`.

Further, this seems like it might have affected my ability to do `cm_transitions` since when I
tried some new BOR and EOR randoms code I made I got something like:

```
10:59:52.550 2015/10/11 [mhttpd,ERROR] [midas.c:9293:rpc_client_connect,ERROR] cannot connect to host "localhost", port 8882: connect() returned -1, errno 106 (Transport endpoint is already connected)
```

and

```
10:59:52.596 2015/10/11 [mhttpd,ERROR] [midas.c:10555:rpc_client_call,ERROR] call to "triggerfe201" on "localhost" RPC "rc_transition": send_tcp() failed
```

and

```
10:59:52.652 2015/10/11 [mhttpd,ERROR] [midas.c:5703:cm_shutdown,ERROR] Cannot connect to client 'triggerfe201' on host 'localhost', port 8882
```

Now I *think* Amy ran a frontend with a `cm_transition` even after we updated the midas code with
the change I'll describe below, so that doesn't make sense really even if what I say is a partial
explaination.

I found the following code in `midas.c` function `cm_connect_experiment1()`

```
 2163    status = db_open_database("ODB", odb_size, &hDB, client_name);
 2164    if (status != DB_SUCCESS && status != DB_CREATED) {
 2165       cm_msg(MERROR, "cm_connect_experiment1", "cannot open database");
 2166       return status;
 2167    }
 2168 
 2169    size = sizeof(disable_bind_rpc_to_localhost);
 2170    status = db_get_value(hDB, 0, "/Experiment/Security/Enable non-localhost RPC", &disable_bind_rpc_to_localhost, &size, TID_BOOL, TRUE);
 2171    assert(status == DB_SUCCESS);
 2172 
 2173    /* now setup client info */
 2174    if (!disable_bind_rpc_to_localhost)
 2175       strlcpy(local_host_name, "localhost", sizeof(local_host_name));
 2176    else
 2177       gethostname(local_host_name, sizeof(local_host_name));
```

So this seemed to be related, given what line 2174 says.  I then checked the git diff and got:

```
commit 7839d04b9abbb0be9c5122e6c830682723020f1c
Author: Konstantin Olchanski <olchansk@home>
Date:   Fri Jul 24 12:31:57 2015 -0700

    Use localhost for RPC communications if "/Experiment/Bind RPC to localhost" is set to "y"
```

Then doing a specific diff to that commit and searching on `midas.c` I found that:

```	
-   size = sizeof(bind_rpc_to_localhost);
-   status = db_get_value(hDB, 0, "/Experiment/Bind RPC to localhost", &bind_rpc_to_localhost, &size, TID_BOOL, TRUE);
+   size = sizeof(disable_bind_rpc_to_localhost);
+   status = db_get_value(hDB, 0, "/Experiment/Security/Enable non-localhost RPC", &disable_bind_rpc_to_localhost, &size, TID_BOOL, TRUE);
    assert(status == DB_SUCCESS);
 
    /* now setup client info */
-   if (bind_rpc_to_localhost)
+   if (!disable_bind_rpc_to_localhost)
       strlcpy(local_host_name, "localhost", sizeof(local_host_name));
    else
       gethostname(local_host_name, sizeof(local_host_name));

```

So, it seems like the convention has changed in terms of which ODB variable controls things.  I
first tried to set "/Experiment/Bind RPC to localhost" like the git commit comment said.  To no
avail.  But then I saw the above code change and changed "/Experiment/Security/Enable
non-localhost RPC" to "y".  This let the `triggerfe2` frontend run under the host
`jiajin.spa.umn.edu` as was previously observed.

I don't really know what this all means, but I looked up
[RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call) on Wikipedia.  It seems this must be
the way MIDAS is executing the functions in all of the frontends at the appropriate times.  I
sort-of wondered about this, since the function prototypes are in each frontend and the main is
included via the `mfe.o` binary, it wouldn't seem like there is a reference in the MIDAS calling
code to these functions -- except to explicitly construct the expected symbol names and call
those.  At that point, as I understand, you might as well do it as RPC so you can also call it on
a remote processor.   I'd like to find the specific RPC calls in the MIDAS code. 

I looked in the `mfe.c` code a bit and see that the declarations are `extern` so that shows how
the frontends can declare their functions begin_run .. etc as necessary.  It still doesn't show
how MIDAS itself can initiate things to happen in the frontend.  Of course the `main()` function
was in `mfe.c` so all those functions can be accessed from there, but it's not clear how MIDAS
syncrhonizes the action of the independent frontends.  That's where RPC must come in. 

```
extern INT frontend_init(void);
```
