Run 53 DCRC 50 data in DIB 3
============================

For a formal comparison to the data we took a couple days ago, we switched to DCRC 50
(`131.225.52.181`) on DIB 3 to have a comparison between RevC.1 (DCRC 50) and RevC (DCRC 31).
Overall it looks like the DCRC 50 is worse, indicating maybe a problem with the RevC.1 in general.
It is hard to tell with just single pulses though, so we took 10 minutes of data in this
configuration too.
