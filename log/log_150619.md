Summary of Today
================

To be noted more fully later.

 * got here and took the data out of flash.
 * set up very simple processing scripts -- noticed that when we have no QI in the data, then the
     BatNoise fails
 * worked with the data and got some distance in "manual" data taking and flashing -- want to
     propose a schedule. 
 * took some more late night data

Basic Run 53 Schedule
=====================

  * shield up Monday 6/22
  * Monday also assess the relative calibration
  * Monday also assess the threshold
  * Tuesday stable data 1 series w/ flash and cool ~ 1 hr
     - 2 series Ba
     - 2 series Y
     - 6 series Cf
     - 2 series Bga
     - bake overnight 

I think we can use a sort of a "shift" schedule.  Suppose we have about 12 hours of data taking a
day.  Each person (at least 4, maybe 6) can be responsible for about 3 specific hours of data
taking a day in shifts 8-11, 11-14, 14-17, 17-20.  I know the 17-20 shift is rough, so I'll be
willing to take that one.  In addition, analyzers can take ~ 2 hrs of the day to make plots and
process the data as it comes in.  This includes at least Anthony, Matt, Allison, but can probably
also include Amy (arriving Tuesday), Nick and Dan.  Plus whoever is willing from upstairs.  I'd
like to set aside about 3 hours on (say) Thursday and Friday next week for MIDAS DAQ testing, but
this could potentially be after 20:00. 

  * Also we'd want to assess the trigger threshold formally.  What data can we take to do that?
      The only thing I can think of is to take randoms, a lot of them.  Then you have to do a very
      wide window OF, and get rid of junk.  Then look at what's left.  The tricky part is, we need
      to have trigger information written out and I'm not sure it is in the LabView in any special
      way.
