Summary of Today
================

To be noted more fully later.

 * got here and took the data out of flash.
 * set up very simple processing scripts -- noticed that when we have no QI in the data, then the
     BatNoise fails
 * worked with the data and got some distance in "manual" data taking and flashing -- want to
     propose a schedule.
