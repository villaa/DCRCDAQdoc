Run 53 G106a DCRC comparisons
=============================

Yesterday we were having a look at some of the pulses that came out of the 3-dib setup for the UMN
K100 Run 53 data run with G106a.  We'll continue on some of this today.  We started with DCRC 50
(`131.225.52.181`) on DIB 3 and I noticed some "bad" phonon pulses.  Or at least some that looked
consistent with the bad ones from [Allisons note UMN-MISC-166](http://www.hep.umn.edu/cdms/cdms_restricted/K100/analysis/PulseAnalysis_140521/).

After noticing this we switched over to DCRC 31 (`131.225.52.116`) on DIB 3 to try to see if the
problem followed the DCRC or the QET channels. 

Firstly, on many channels we noticed a pre-pulse spike that I've never seen before.  It is a
curious feature and I'm not sure what can cause something like that.  It seems like it can't be
phonon physics:
