MIDAS cm_transition testing and rollbacks
=========================================

Because of the problems encountered yesterday, I've begun more tests and a system of rollbacks of
the MIDAS code to see if "something went wrong" or if this is expected behavior.  I've _never_
been able to get the `cm_register_transition` functionality to work.  I've also experience a lot
of strange behavior along the way. 

One thing that seems tied up with all of this, but I can't be sure, is the fact that something
changed in MIDAS where I'm allowed to run on the host "localhost" whereas before the host
"jiajin.spa.umn.edu" was always displayed.  For our system, this should be truly irrelevant
because those hosts are one in the same, but because of the RPC errors I get (see yesterday's log
note) I can't shake the feeling that it's related, but I can't say *how*.

I did the command `git log -g` in the MIDAS repository and saw that there were three dates that
the MIDAS code was pulled from bitbucket.  They were 2015-09-29, 2015-09-18, and 2014-04-02.  I
start tests on the "current" version and begin with the rollbacks. 


Current 2015/09/29 (SHA: cf30abc8ff61ed1e5a1907e98757dd265f8bade8)
------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, now I've got the code running with our most recent install of MIDAS.  The relevant lines in
the `frontend_init` are as follows:

```
 276   //register transition on start that sets random parameters
 277   if (cm_register_transition(TR_START, initialize_randoms_info, 500) != CM_SUCCESS) {
 278       printf("triggerfe2(frontend_init):Cannot register transition");
 279   }
 280 
 281   //register a deferred transition for EOR randoms
 282   if (cm_register_deferred_transition(TR_STOP, defer_for_end_randoms) != CM_SUCCESS) {
 283       printf("triggerfe2(frontend_init):Cannot register deferred STOP transition");
 284   }
 285 
 286 
 287    return SUCCESS;
 288 }
```

In this mode, with all the frontends are running on `localhost` because `/Experiment/Security/Enable
non-localhost RPC` is set to "n."  I get several errors directly after starting the run that look
like this:

```
13:22:28.395 2015/10/12 [mhttpd,ERROR] [midas.c:4444:cm_transition,ERROR] Could not start a run: cm_transition() status 503, message '(null)'

13:22:27.629 2015/10/12 [mhttpd,ERROR] [midas.c:10555:rpc_client_call,ERROR] call to "triggerfe201" on "localhost" RPC "rc_transition": send_tcp() failed

13:22:27.607 2015/10/12 [mhttpd,ERROR] [system.c:4345:send_tcp,ERROR] send(socket=14,size=40) returned -1, errno: 32 (Broken pipe)

13:22:27.585 2015/10/12 [mhttpd,ERROR] [midas.c:3660:cm_transition_call,ERROR] cannot connect to client "triggerfe201" on host localhost, port 18977, status 503

13:22:27.584 2015/10/12 [mhttpd,ERROR] [midas.c:9293:rpc_client_connect,ERROR] cannot connect to host "localhost", port 18977: connect() returned -1, errno 106 (Transport endpoint is already connected)
```

So, maybe this has to do with using `localhost` instead of our canonical `jiajin.spa.umn.edu`.
I'll try to change this by setting the `/Experiment/Security/Enable non-localhost RPC` to "y"
instead of "n."  Now the frontends are all running under host `jiajin.spa.umn.edu`.

In this iteration the code seems to have hung on the transition.  I had to go into
`/Runinfo/Transition in progress` and set it to "0" because it was "1" for an extended time.  I
wonder if it would have timed-out.  Eventually I got this error:

```
13:36:59.996 2015/10/12 [mhttpd,ERROR] [midas.c:4444:cm_transition,ERROR] Could not start a run: cm_transition() status 504, message '(null)'

13:36:54.963 2015/10/12 [mhttpd,ERROR] [system.c:4633:ss_recv_net_command,ERROR] timeout receiving network command header
```

And then eventually this message:

```
13:38:00.091 2015/10/12 [mserver,INFO] Client 'triggerfe201' (PID 1194653) on database 'ODB' removed by cm_watchdog (idle 60.2s,TO 60s)
```

So I suppose I should confirm when the relevant lines of code are commented out, that the
frontends work and we can take data.  I've now commented out lines 276-284 in the code above. And
recompiled.  

The data ran as expected in this mode.  File copy working and everything. 

I guess before moving on we can add some code to give more idea of what's happening in the failure
case.  I've added print statements in the `frontend_init` of `triggerfe2` in order to see if the
transitions get registered (although they clearly aren't working as expected).  The code below is
the updated (relevant) code. 

```
 273   printf ("Trigger mode = %d, ", trigmode);
 274   printf ("Pileup cut = %f\n", PILEUP_CUT);
 275 
 276   //register transition on start that sets random parameters
 277   if (cm_register_transition(TR_START, initialize_randoms_info, 500) != CM_SUCCESS) {
 278       printf("triggerfe2(frontend_init):Cannot register transition\n");
 279   }
 280   else{
 281       printf("triggerfe2(frontend_init):Registered TR_START transition\n");
 282   }
 283 
 284   //register a deferred transition for EOR randoms
 285   if (cm_register_deferred_transition(TR_STOP, defer_for_end_randoms) != CM_SUCCESS) {
 286       printf("triggerfe2(frontend_init):Cannot register deferred STOP transition\n");
 287   }
 288   else{
 289       printf("triggerfe2(frontend_init):Registered TR_STOP deferred transition\n");
 290   }
 291 
 292 
 293    return SUCCESS;
 294 }
```

I'll try this one with host `jiajin.spa.umn.edu`. 

The messages printed as expected but the frontend still failed on the transition, eventually going
to the stopped state after the following errors:

```
14:04:40.998 2015/10/12 [mhttpd,ERROR] [midas.c:5730:cm_shutdown,ERROR] Killing and Deleting client 'triggerfe201' pid 1195905

14:04:40.997 2015/10/12 [mhttpd,ERROR] [midas.c:5728:cm_shutdown,ERROR] Client 'triggerfe201' not responding to shutdown command

14:04:36.086 2015/10/12 [mhttpd,ERROR] [midas.c:3660:cm_transition_call,ERROR] cannot connect to client "triggerfe201" on host jiajin.spa.umn.edu, port 39997, status 503

14:04:36.085 2015/10/12 [mhttpd,ERROR] [midas.c:9321:rpc_client_connect,ERROR] timeout on receive remote computer info: 
```

Seems like the problem is happening when trying to actually call the `initialize_randoms_info` function.

Rollback to 2015/09/18 (SHA: c6bd52df5e27a1fd61e4a57460e6823058e7a0c8)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: for some reason the frontends are now yellow on the equipment frontpage when running instead
of green.  I have no idea why this is true, or what the color code means.  I find the MIDAS
documentation to be lacking in such descriptions. 

Ok, now let's try with the rolled-back version to see if this something to do with MIDAS hosts and
RPC communication or what.  I'm leaning away from this possibility now, because we tried both
hosts above. 

Each time I change the MIDAS install I do a `make clean` and a `make`.

NOTE: now all the frontends are yellow.  I don't know what this means.

This time (running on `jiajin.spa.umn.edu`) the frontend seems to hang.  I don't know what's
wrong, but it doesn't show signs of stopping, so I'll use `/Runinfo/Transition in progress` to
pull it out of the transition.   Here are the errors I got:

```

```

I guess I'll try it again by switching `/Experiment/Security/Enable non-localhost RPC` to "n" to
allow the localhost command running.  It didn't work and I got these errors.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I guess, let's try to roll back all the way to last year's version.  Surprisingly, even in this
version the frontends are yellow and we're running on localhost.  It seems to be responding to
some of the security sub-tree, which I thought wasn't there in this version, so that's a little
confusing.  Either way I'll try it with frontends running on `localhost` and then with them
running on `jiajin.spa.umn.edu`. 

On `localhost` we failed immediately with these errors and an immediate kill of `triggerfe2`:

```

The last error seems new and is perhaps interesting.  Let me try with `jiajin.spa.umn.edu`.  Here
goes.  Failure, big surprise.  Error messages as follows.

Summary
-------

Ok, well I guess we really have a problem here, let me look at the data and try to figure out
what's going on, I'm beginning to think that this strange fact that I've left out till now, but
has been true since the beginning is screwing us up here.  That is, the `triggerfe2` frontend has
a strange behavior.  When started it makes another entry on the "Programs" page, and turns that
green (and the one that existed before green too) and this is the only frontend that does this.
It's probably because of the naming convention and the "-i" option.  It seems like it shouldn't be
run with the "-i" option, which makes sense since it controls many towers.  But our setup had it
messed up to begin with.  I wonder if that's leading to communication ambiguitiy.
