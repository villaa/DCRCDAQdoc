Setting up Midas again
======================

We pulled the git version of MidasDAQ using the following clone.

```
$ssh jiajin.spa.umn.edu
$sudo -u cdmssoft -s
$cd ~
$cd repositories/
$git clone villaa@nero.stanford.edu:/data/git/DAQ/MidasDAQ MidasDAQ
```

This goes into the top-level repositories directory where we can put all the code repository
versions and then sim-link to them at the lower levels.  For example I then did:

```
$cd ../scdmsDAQ/
$rm MidasDAQ
$ln -s ln -s /home/hep/cdmssoft/repositories/MidasDAQ
```

We then had to go into the `MidasDAQ/src` directories and make the binaries like:

```
$cd MidasDAQ/src
$make dcrc_driver.exe
$make towerfe3.exe
$make triggerfe2.exe
```

Note that the "all" tag does not make the appropriate binaries, and that the makesystem for this
code should be fixed to be a lot better.
