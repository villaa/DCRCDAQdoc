Setting up Midas again
======================

get code
--------

We pulled the git version of MidasDAQ using the following clone.

```
$ssh jiajin.spa.umn.edu
$sudo -u cdmssoft -s
$cd ~
$cd repositories/
$git clone villaa@nero.stanford.edu:/data/git/DAQ/MidasDAQ MidasDAQ
```

This goes into the top-level repositories directory where we can put all the code repository
versions and then sim-link to them at the lower levels.  For example I then did:

```
$cd ../scdmsDAQ/
$rm MidasDAQ
$ln -s ln -s /home/hep/cdmssoft/repositories/MidasDAQ
```

compile code
-----------

We then had to go into the `MidasDAQ/src` directories and make the binaries like:

```
$cd MidasDAQ/src
$make dcrc_driver.exe
$make towerfe3.exe
$make triggerfe2.exe
```

Note that the "all" tag does not make the appropriate binaries, and that the makesystem for this
code should be fixed to be a lot better. 

set the exptab
--------------

For our system at UMN the exptab needs to be changed so that it has the appropriate user and
experiment name.  It consists of the single line:

```
cdms_UMN /home/hep/cdmssoft/scdmsDAQ/MidasDAQ/online cdmssoft
```

move the startup scripts
------------------------

So there was a startup script that is included in the repository that assumes we are running an
experiment name called `cdms_test` and that our hostname begins with `dcrc01`.  Neither of these
things are true at UMN (I guess we can change them to be) so we needed a new startup script.  This
goes in the `MidasDAQ/online/bin` directory.  It is called `start_daq_local.sh`.

```
!/bin/sh

cd /home/hep/cdmssoft/scdmsDAQ/MidasDAQ/online

case `hostname` in
jiajin*)
    echo "Good, we are on jiajin!"
    ;;
*)
    echo "The start_daq script should be executed on jiajin"
    exit 1
    ;;
esac

odbedit -c clean

mhttpd  -p 8081 -D -e cdms_UMN
mserver -p 7071 -D
mlogger -D -e cdms_UMN

end file
```

With the current setup in response to this script we got:

```
Good, we are on jiajin!
[ODBEdit,ERROR] [system.c:1021:ss_shm_delete,ERROR] shm_unlink(/cdms_UMN_SYSMSG_SHM) errno 2 (No such file or directory)
[ODBEdit,ERROR] [system.c:1021:ss_shm_delete,ERROR] shm_unlink(/cdms_UMN_SYSTEM_SHM) errno 2 (No such file or directory)
Becoming a daemon...
mserver started interactively
Becoming a daemon...
Becoming a daemon...
```

Basically, it worked, I've seen those errors before or something like them.  I'm not totally sure
what it means, but it's clear that the ODB is not initialized totally.  We have to find out how to
populate the ODB.
