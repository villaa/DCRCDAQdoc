Setting up Midas again
======================

get code
--------

We pulled the git version of MidasDAQ using the following clone.

```
$ssh jiajin.spa.umn.edu
$sudo -u cdmssoft -s
$cd ~
$cd repositories/
$git clone villaa@nero.stanford.edu:/data/git/DAQ/MidasDAQ MidasDAQ
```

This goes into the top-level repositories directory where we can put all the code repository
versions and then sim-link to them at the lower levels.  For example I then did:

```
$cd ../scdmsDAQ/
$rm MidasDAQ
$ln -s ln -s /home/hep/cdmssoft/repositories/MidasDAQ
```

compile code
-----------

We then had to go into the `MidasDAQ/src` directories and make the binaries like:

```
$cd MidasDAQ/src
$make dcrc_driver.exe
$make towerfe3.exe
$make triggerfe2.exe
```

Note that the "all" tag does not make the appropriate binaries, and that the makesystem for this
code should be fixed to be a lot better. 

set the exptab
--------------

For our system at UMN the exptab needs to be changed so that it has the appropriate user and
experiment name.  It consists of the single line:

```
cdms_UMN /home/hep/cdmssoft/scdmsDAQ/MidasDAQ/online cdmssoft
```

move the startup scripts
------------------------

So there was a startup script that is included in the repository that assumes we are running an
experiment name called `cdms_test` and that our hostname begins with `dcrc01`.  Neither of these
things are true at UMN (I guess we can change them to be) so we needed a new startup script.  This
goes in the `MidasDAQ/online/bin` directory. 

```
#!/bin/sh

cd /home/hep/cdmssoft/scdmsDAQ/MidasDAQ/online

case `hostname` in
jiajin*)
    echo "Good, we are on jiajin!"
    ;;
*)
    echo "The start_daq script should be executed on jiajin"
    exit 1
    ;;
esac

odbedit -c clean

mhttpd  -p 8081 -D -e cdms_UMN
mserver -p 7071 -D
mlogger -D -e cdms_UMN

#end file
```
