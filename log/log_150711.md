Noise progress R53
==================

So, we've come to somewhat of a crossroads on the R53 efforts.  We've got some use out of it, but
the phonon channels are plagued with a lot of noise.   We did learn about the charge threshold and
have successfully seen activation peaks.  This will be important for future analysis.   This past
Thursday, some purchase was made regarding the charge noise.  After Matt and I looked at some DIBs
by themselves, a pattern emerged where DIB 2 (read by DCRC 33, with a 100 MHz filter) seemed to
have clean pulses.

While other DIBs (unfiltered) seemed to have very bad pulses and baseline noise.  For example DIB
1, DCRC 55 and DIB 3 DCRC 50:

![DIB 3 DCRC 50](figures/DIB3_DCRC50_only_singlePulse0_150709.png)

This lead to the suspicion that the DCRC versions might be at fault (remember DCRC 33 is RevC
and the others are RevC.1).  Matt began a more precise program of changing this DCRC around to
different DIBs Friday.

Seems like what we know is:

  * phonon noise comes in two varieties standard LF noise and sharp pulse distortions (shelving)
  * 100 MHz filter mitigates some noise
  * 3.2 MHz filter mitigates some noise and changes the QET parameters notably
  * noise on one channel can be affected by having the QET biases on another channel set, even if
      that channel is on a different DIB
  * there is large periodic noise before the timing link has been set up when running multiple
      boards

I want to think of some concrete studies to do in order to understand how the noise comes in.  I
guess first, I want to understand at which step the noise comes from the timing link and then
perhaps ramp the QET very slowly and see how the noise "turns on."  We can also characterize the
noise more precisely by taking PSDs. 

**Random Thoughts**

When I look at the really jagged pulses (shelving, see DIB 1 and DIB 3 above), it looks as if the
baselines are changing perhaps.  But it seems they are more predisposed to changing on the falling
edge of the pulse.  If we assume the phonon circuit is behaving correctly, it means that there is
a sharp change in the current through the TES branch.  Could these be micro-changes in the QET
bias?  If they are truly random, I'd expect to see these in the random noise triggers, but I don't
think I do.  Maybe that's something to search for. 

Perhaps I can do the following set of things:

  * confirm which stage introduces the noise from the "timing link"
  * take long PSDs Normal/Transition/Supercond with RevC and filter on all the DIBs
  * try to assess the QET induced noise, first do a single unfiltered board and get one channel
      working, slowly ramp other QETs, noting pulse differences
  * then use a filtered board and try turning on the other DCRC power, ramp those QETs to look for
      differences in the filtered boards channels
