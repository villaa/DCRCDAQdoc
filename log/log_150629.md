DAQ MIDAS code mystery
======================

I didn't do much on this today but I made a test and found out that you **can** have an include
file that contains a `main()` function. 

file `test.h`

```
int main()
{
           printf("Hello");
              return 0;
}
```

file `test.c`

```
\#include<stdio.h>
\#include<stdlib.h>
\#include "test.h"
```

Interestingly, this doesn't work with the includes switched so that the `test.h` comes first.  I
guess that makes sense, because the `test.h` uses a `printf` function which is included in one of
the other included headers.  I guess this means the one with the `main()` function should come
*after* headers including any functions used in it.  In MIDAS this is presumably `midas.h`.
