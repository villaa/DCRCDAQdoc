Run 53 DCRC 50 data in DIB 3
============================

This is a continuation from notes in `log_150611.md`. In the same subheading.

In addition to the pulses we saw from DCRC 50 to compare the by-eye quality, we took some pulses
that looked saturated.  The saturation happened at different places for different values of the
output gain.  I don't understand this currently, perhaps looking back at the diagram on the notes
from `log_150611.md` will help later.

We should note that on DCRC RevC.1 the output gain is specified by a 2-bit value, so anything
beyond an output gain of 3 doesn't really make sense.  The labView VI apparently just tries to
write a larger-than-two-bit value (the DCRC RevC has this amplification setting as a 3-bit value)
and ends up with the last two bits of that value, so the pattern repeats every 3 gain increments.
