Run 53 DCRC 50 data in DIB 3
============================

This is a continuation from notes in `log_150611.md`. In the same subheading.

In addition to the pulses we saw from DCRC 50 to compare the by-eye quality, we took some pulses
that looked saturated.  The saturation happened at different places for different values of the
output gain.  I don't understand this currently, perhaps looking back at the diagram on the notes
from `log_150611.md` will help later. 

Channel A using Output Gain 1, and Frontend Gain 1.0:
