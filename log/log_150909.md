MIDAS DAQ running
=================

Take a breath, run triggerfe2
-----------------------------

Ok, the other programs seem to set up the ODB OK.  I now want to run triggerfe2, but am worried
that it will screw things up.  I already know it will add towers up to 30 that I don't need.  But
OK, let's try it for a short time and see what changes are made to the ODB.

I did this, it created the anticipated Tower sub-trees at the `/Equipment/` node, but other than
that it seems to have worked fine.  I should now run my script to set up appropriate ODB variables
for the program starting, this I do in the next section.

Set up the program control from mhttpd
--------------------------------------

So we can control the "frontend" programs I've configured so far from the MIDAS frontend.  This
has to be configured though.  I should now run my script to set up appropriate ODB variables
and this will configure it.  I use the following script, which has a bunch of stuff hard-coded for
UMN.

```
#!/bin/sh

#script to set up specifics of ODB after dcrc_server.exe, towerfe3.exe, triggerfe2.exe
#initialization.

#odbedit -e ${EXP_NAME} -c 'mkdir "/Programs/triggerfe2"'
#odbedit -e ${EXP_NAME} -c 'create STRING "/Programs/triggerfe2/Start command"[256]'
#odbedit -e ${EXP_NAME} -c 'create BOOL "/Programs/triggerfe2/Required"'
odbedit -e ${EXP_NAME} -c 'set "/Programs/triggerfe201/Start command" "'${MIDAS_DIR}'/src/triggerfe2.exe -D"'

#a dummy variable for flash sequencing
odbedit -e ${EXP_NAME} -c 'create STRING "/Playground/Run sequence"[256]'
odbedit -e ${EXP_NAME} -c 'set "/Playground/Run sequence" idle'
#odbedit -e ${EXP_NAME} -c 'del "/Playground/Run sequence"'
```

This program is in the repository at: `MidasDAQ/setup/umn`.

This seems to have worked properly.  Note that all of the programs except `triggerfe2.exe` stopped
running, probably because we do not have the DCRC communication setup via the TCP/IP connection.
Errors like this come up:

```
[triggerfe201,INFO] Client 'towerfe3_01' on buffer 'SYSTEM' removed by cm_watchdog (idle 60.3s,TO 60s)
```

Presumably this signals an idle process, no DCRCs are enabled -- so that makes sense.  Not sure
why `triggerfe2.exe` can plow through, maybe because it doesn't require DCRC connectivity, or any
connectivity really... it just sits and waits for communication (I *think*). 

Setting up Amy and Joel's DAQ UI
--------------------------------

This was traditionally the easiest thing and was originally done in the 6/25/15 log notes:


*COPIED FROM 6/25/15 LOG NOTES:* Need to create a "Custom" directory in the odb tree. Then need a "Path" and another variable which
is the name of the "button" you want.  In this case we named our button DCRC_UI.  This will
connect our button to the html file that's inserted in that variable.  We set the "Path" to
`/home/hep/cdmssoft/scdmsDAQ/dcrc_ui/online/` and the  "DCRC_UI" to `dcrc.html`.

```
[local:cdms_UMN:S]/>mkdir Custom     
[local:cdms_UMN:S]/>create STRING Custom/Path
String length [32]: 256
[local:cdms_UMN:S]/>ls Custom/
Path                            
[local:cdms_UMN:S]/>exit      
jiajin:dcrc_ui cdmssoft$pwd
/home/hep/cdmssoft/scdmsDAQ/dcrc_ui
jiajin:dcrc_ui cdmssoft$odbedit
[local:cdms_UMN:S]/>create STRING Custom/DCRC_UI
String length [32]: 
[local:cdms_UMN:S]/>exit
```

In the end our setup looked like this:
