Getting things together for a UMN run
=====================================

We want to be able to run the MIDAS DAQ with the USD UI and all the Berkeley/UBC detector tools at
the UMN test facility.  We have had data run with the DCRCs since the beginning of our test
facility and data was taken through MIDAS by Oser and company in May 2014.  We want to make the
MIDAS data taking our standard.  For this we need:

* detector setup (UCB/UBC tools)
* data taking (MIDAS/USD UI)
* data reduction (cdmsbats mods) 

We have used the following DCRC boards with the given IP addresses:

* DCRC 31 `131.225.52.116` RevC
* DCRC 33 `131.225.53.84`  RevC
* DCRC 50 `131.225.52.181` RevC.1
* DCRC X  `131.225.52.85`  RevC.1

Note that these addresses are in the Fermilab domain if you look on the web.  Obviously, we just
took the setup over and use it on our private network.  How this works is simple -- we get a
computer with a second network adapter.  We instruct it to use this network adapter for all
requests to the IP addresses of the DCRCs via a routing table. This adapter is then hooked to a
switch (which can supply power over ethernet, PoE) and the switch is hooked to the DCRCs.

To get the routing table on a linux machine use:

```
$netstat -rn
```

Note that our data taking computer is set to be `jiajin.spa.umn.edu`, we can see the routing table
for this computer:

```
jiajin:src cdmssoft$netstat -rn
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
128.101.220.0   0.0.0.0         255.255.254.0   U         0 0          0 eth0
131.225.52.0    0.0.0.0         255.255.252.0   U         0 0          0 eth1
0.0.0.0         128.101.221.254 0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 eth0
```

compared to the routing table of a non-DAQ computer like `vegemite.spa.umn.edu`:

```
vegemite:pics villaa$netstat -rn
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
128.101.220.0   0.0.0.0         255.255.254.0   U         0 0          0 em1
0.0.0.0         128.101.221.254 0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 em1
```
