Getting things together for a UMN run
=====================================

We want to be able to run the MIDAS DAQ with the USD UI and all the Berkeley/UBC detector tools at
the UMN test facility.  We have had data run with the DCRCs since the beginning of our test
facility and data was taken through MIDAS by Oser and company in May 2014.  We want to make the
MIDAS data taking our standard.  For this we need:

* detector setup (UCB/UBC tools)
* data taking (MIDAS/USD UI)
* data reduction (cdmsbats mods) 

We have used the following DCRC boards with the given IP addresses:

* DCRC 31 `131.225.52.116` RevC
* DCRC 33 `131.225.53.84`  RevC
* DCRC 50 `131.225.52.181` RevC.1
* DCRC X  `131.225.52.85`  RevC.1

Note that these addresses are in the Fermilab domain if you look on the web.  Obviously, we just
took the setup over and use it on our private network.  How this works is simple -- we get a
computer with a second network adapter.  We instruct it to use this network adapter for all
requests to the IP addresses of the DCRCs via a routing table. This adapter is then hooked to a
switch (which can supply power over ethernet, PoE) and the switch is hooked to the DCRCs.

To get the routing table on a linux machine use:

```
$netstat -rn
```

Note that our data taking computer is set to be `jiajin.spa.umn.edu`, we can see the routing table
for this computer:

```
jiajin:src cdmssoft$netstat -rn
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
128.101.220.0   0.0.0.0         255.255.254.0   U         0 0          0 eth0
131.225.52.0    0.0.0.0         255.255.252.0   U         0 0          0 eth1
0.0.0.0         128.101.221.254 0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 eth0
```

compared to the routing table of a non-DAQ computer like `vegemite.spa.umn.edu`:

```
vegemite:pics villaa$netstat -rn
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface

0.0.0.0         128.101.221.254 0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 em1
```

Telnet to the DCRCs: a reminder
==============================

We use telnet to talk to the DCRCs, from a computer with the above-mentioned routing table setup,
we can simply do:

```
$telnet 131.225.52.116 5000
```
to connect to `port 5000` on `DCRC 31`.  Each DCRC has three ports in RevC and RevC.1, these are
`ports 5000,5001,5002`.

Even if the connection is successful you will not see much unless you do a `help` or `sock`
command. 

```
jiajin:src cdmssoft$telnet 131.225.52.85 5000

The `sock` command shows as 0,1,2 the socket connections it has available (`ports
5000,5001,5002`).  If it says connected in there it means the port is in use by a connection. You
can use the command `quit n` where `n` is 0,1,2 to quit connections to ports 5000,5001,5002
respectively.  Simply typing `quit` will quit the current connection. 

Bringing up MIDAS
================


Setting up our DCRCs
====================

`time: 14:44`

I set up the DCRCs we have as DCRC 1,2,3,4 in MIDAS.  I am only using our unknown ID DCRC X
because it is a RevC.1 and I want to try the new firmware.  This setup will change around as I do
things. 

|ID #   |MIDAS #   |IP   |Rev   |Enabled   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|DCRC 31   |2   |`131.225.52.116`   |C   |n   |
|DCRC 33   |1   |`131.225.53.84`   |C   |n   |
|DCRC 50   |3   |`131.225.52.181`   |C.1   |n   |
|DCRC X   |4   |`131.225.52.85`   |C.1   |y   |

The "enable" is set by changing the MIDAS ODB variable corresponding to each DCRC, for example the
variable `/Equipment/Tower01/Settings/DCRC1/Enabled` controls the value for MIDAS DCRC #1. 

Firmware for our DCRCs
======================

It has been suggested that I update to the newest firmware for our RevC.1 DCRCs.  There are some
links that will help with this. [This
page](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/CDMS/WED+Resources+-+DAQ+Development) gives the
newest firmware version binary download below "How to update firmware." Also, the DCRC register
map is [here](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/CDMS/DCRC+Documentation).

`time: 14:52`

Bruno emailed and gave me the above two links for the firmware.  He also connected me to [this
page](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/CDMS/DCRC+v3.1+%28rev+C.1%29+test+signal+notes%3A+also+partly+applicable+to+RevC)
to see how to set the test signal on the newer firmware (post-April 2014).

Flashing and flash sequencing
=============================

I learned the settings for the flash sequence used at UMN.  We use a current of -0.6\ mA on LED
1&2 and have a flash duration of 100\ mus and a flash off time of 5000\ mus.

There is a MIDAS sequencer that can be used to do long periods of flahsing and/or flash & run
sequences.  The sequencer language is very simplistic, here is an excerpt of a simple code:

```
SET delay 60

ODBGET "/Equipment/Tower01/Settings/DCRC1/Charge/Bias (V)[0]" oCharge
MESSAGE $oCharge

TRANSITION start

  WAIT $delay

TRANSITION stop

ODBset "/Playground/Run sequence" "flash"
TRANSITION start

  WAIT $delay

TRANSITION stop
ODBset "/Playground/Run sequence" "no_flash"
```

The sequencer language is not a very robust high-level language.  This means that scripting
directly in this language is tedious, especially if you have to do something like flash in
intervals all night long.  My approach is to implement 3 Python scripts (to start with) which take
simple inputs and make a sequencer script that can then be loaded and run. 

Scripts
-------

* Flash & Flash: flash for a bit, then wait a bit, then repeat for a length of time
* Bake: start flashing and wait for a length of time
* Flash & Take: flash for a bit, wait a bit, take data, then repeate for a length of time

[Here](https://midas.triumf.ca/MidasWiki/index.php/Sequencer) is a link to various sequencer
commands.  In order to do the things above and restore the DAQ to the current state we probably
need to use `ODBGET` and `ODBSET` to get the charge bias, then set it to zero, then reset it after
baking/flashing.
