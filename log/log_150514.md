Want to try a multi-DCRC test of flashing
========================================

`time 09:40`

Yesterday, had a successful test using the script `flashandflash.py` to create a MIDAS sequencer
script and then run through the MIDAS web interface.  In principle, this can be done for any
number of DCRCs so I should test it with 3 DCRCs today.

People in the lab are doing some PSD measurements, so I should wait until after lunch.
