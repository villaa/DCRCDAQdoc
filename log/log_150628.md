Compiling the MIDAS DTC tools from Bruno
========================================

Bruno has not put the detector tools into a repository yet, although that will happen soon.  He
has made them available to me and I copied the programs to the directory
`~cdmssoft/repositories/MidasDTC`.  The place he put the most updated version of this code was on
nerva at `/nervascratch/serfass/MidasDTC.tar.gz`, this was updated on **18 June 2015**.

Compiling this was a little tricky because the make system didn't work perfectly.   It eventually
got working when I made a few modifications, as listed below. 

  1. Be sure to set the `DTCDIR` environmental variable like `$export
      DTCDIR=/abs/path/to/MidasDTC/`

  2. Change the code for the file `MidasDTC/common/midasControl/VirtualOdbRW.h` because it didn't
      have the member function `odbWriteUint32`  basically you have to add the following to
      `VirtualOdbRW.h`

      ```
      virtual int odbWriteUint32(const char*name, int index, uint32_t value) = 0;
      ```

      ```
      uint32_t TMidasControl::odbReadUint32(const char*name,int index,uint32_t defaultValue)
      {
        uint32_t value = defaultValue;
        if (odbReadAny(name,index,TID_DWORD,&value) == 0)
          return value;
        else
          return defaultValue;
      };
      ```

      and add the appropriate thing to the corresponding `.h` file. 


  3. Change the Makefile in `MidasDTC/common/midasODB/Makefile` to have the lines:

     ```
     ifdef MIDASSYS
     CXXFLAGS += -DHAVE_MIDAS -I$(MIDASSYS)/include -I$(DTCDIR)/common/midasControl
     endif
     ```

     Instead of:

     ```
     ifdef MIDASSYS
     CXXFLAGS += -DHAVE_MIDAS -I$(MIDASSYS)/include -I$(MIDASSYS)/../../online/midasControl 
     endif
     ```

Although, I now realize that this is essentially using the "local" version of `midasControl`
instead of that which comes with the MIDAS package itself.  I guess I don't know why this
directory was packaged with the MidasDTC directory since the code seems out of date.  Indeed on
`cedar.berkeley.edu` the `midasControl` directory packaged with the MIDAS code itself seems
up-to-date and would have removed the necessity for the second and third step above (assuming the
code is in `$(MIDASSYS)/../../online/midasControl`).  I did have a `midasControl/` directory
packaged with my MIDAS code in `MidasDAQ/libGUI/midasControl/` but that seemed to be
not-up-to-date in the sense that it didn't have the `odbWriteUint32` function.

Anyway, it seems to compile now. 

Trying to actually run the program(s)
=====================================

In trying to run the programs it became apparent to me that the permissions of the directory
`MidasDTC` are strange, and the connection information is hard-wired to `cedar.berkeley.edu`

Ok, well I updated the connection information and got the code in `SQUIDtuningGUI` and the
`pulseDisplay` code in the `scdmsDAQ/MidasDAQ/online` directory to run.  Unfortunately the latter
(when trying to start a run) put the MIDAS DAQ into a bad state where it was trying to start a run
but couldnt.  A simple restart did nothing to help this situation. 
I then (maybe stupidly) moved the `.SHM.ODB` file to another file and restarted
MIDAS.  This erased the ODB, as expected.  What I didn't expect was that after restoring the file
the ODB was still gone.  So I have to get that back now (which was a long annoying process, see
the last few days notes).  

This is making me think I really need to understand the driver code.  All of it, in the
`scdmsDAQ/MidasDAQ/online/src` directory is **completely devoid of main()** functions.  Quick web
searches have added confusion as to whether you can have a properly compiled c-code without a main
function.  Generally the answer is no, except (might be special to Linux) doing
[this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5764298/compiling-c-source-code-without-a-main-function):

```
\#include<stdio.h>
\#include<stdlib.h>
_start()
{
   exit(my_main());
}
int my_main()
{
   printf("Hello");
   return 0;
}
```

and compiling like:

```
$gcc -nostartfiles hello.c
```

I see no sign of the flag `-nostartfiles` in the compilation of the MIDAS code.   It appears this
stupid example works for Linux because technically Linux starts at the "entry point" symbol
`_start`, this is implemented in glibc which then enters the execution at `main`.  By using the
`-nostartfiles` flag you're telling it not to use glibc, and therefore the entry point is
`_start`.  See [this](http://www.quora.com/How-can-I-write-a-C-program-without-a-main-function)
article.  

The above is all academic though because I don't see the `-nostartfiles` flag or a symbol named
`_start`.  The main function must be hiding somewhere, but I'll be damned if I could find it.
