Test the calibration data on RevC/C.1
=====================================

`time: 09:43`

Scott Oser said that the DCRC command `cald 1` is supposed to list all the calibration constants
on the boards, there are 50 in all.  He also cautioned against using the calibration features unless
they are extensively tested.  It seemed to him that the default constants seem not-too-bad whereas
if one puts an errant value in the situation may be really bad. 

I tried the command `cald 1` on the RevC board I had hooked up and I get the response `syntax
error?`. 

Bringing up the DAQ for a sequencer test
=======================================

`time 11:47`

Tried hooking up the MIDAS DAQ to MIDAS DCRC 1 `131.225.53.84` RevC board.  Some connection
problems are happening because we want the labview code hooked up on the unused port to monitor
the voltage.  However the labview code seems to give an error when connected to `port 5002`. 

I am trying to run the code created by the `flashandflash.py` program.  The source for that
program is below:

```
#!/usr/bin/env python

import os
import subprocess
import sys
import argparse
from argparse import ArgumentParser, ArgumentTypeError
import re
#
# This script creates a MIDAS sequencer file (.msl) based on the inputs in order to flash LEDs of
# the given DCRCs
#

def makeSequencerMSL(pdcrc,ponoff,pduration):

        #turn the QBias off
        turnQBiasOff(pdcrc)

        #split the onoff into two numbers
	if(ponoff is not None):
	  sonoff = ponoff.split(',')

        #go into flash state
        print 'ODBSET "/Playground/Run sequence" "flash"'
        print 'WAIT 60'
        print 'ODBSET "/Playground/Run sequence" "no_flash"'

        #restore Qbias to previous state
        turnQBiasBackOn(pdcrc)

	return

def turnQBiasOff(pdcrc):

        #loop over the DCRC list and output .msl commands
	for board in pdcrc:
	  print 'ODBGET "/Equipment/Tower01/Settings/DCRC'+str(board)+'/Charge/Bias (V)[0]" Q0'+str(board)
	  print 'ODBSET "/Equipment/Tower01/Settings/DCRC'+str(board)+'/Charge/Bias (V)[0]" 0'
	  print 'ODBGET "/Equipment/Tower01/Settings/DCRC'+str(board)+'/Charge/Bias (V)[1]" Q1'+str(board)
	  print 'ODBSET "/Equipment/Tower01/Settings/DCRC'+str(board)+'/Charge/Bias (V)[1]" 0'

	return

def turnQBiasBackOn(pdcrc):

        #loop over the DCRC list and output .msl commands
	for board in pdcrc:
	  print 'ODBSET "/Equipment/Tower01/Settings/DCRC'+str(board)+'/Charge/Bias (V)[0]" $Q0'+str(board)
	  print 'ODBSET "/Equipment/Tower01/Settings/DCRC'+str(board)+'/Charge/Bias (V)[1]" $Q1'+str(board)

	return

#from the stack: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6512280/accept-a-range-of-numbers-in-the-form-of-0-5-using-pythons-argparse
def parseDCRCList(string):
       
        #split with comma first
	rangelist = string.split(',')

        #make a unique list of DCRC numbers
	dcrclist = []
	for part in rangelist:
          m = re.match(r'(\d+)(?:-(\d+))?$', part)
          # ^ (or use .split('-'). anyway you like.)
          if not m:
            raise ArgumentTypeError("'" + string + "' is not a range of number.  Expected forms like '0-5' or '2'.")
          start = m.group(1)
          end = m.group(2) or start
          templist = list(range(int(start,10), int(end,10)+1))
	  dcrclist.extend(templist)

        #convert list to set to get unique elements
	dcrclist = list(set(dcrclist))

	#I think that orders stuff too, but let's make sure
	dcrclist.sort()

	return dcrclist

#the stuff below is so this functionality can be used as a script
########################################################################
if __name__ == "__main__":

        #make a parser for the input
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Get flash specifications')
	parser.add_argument('--dcrc', type=parseDCRCList)
	parser.add_argument('--onoff', help='<on time (s)>,<off time (s)>')
	parser.add_argument('--duration', help='flash duration (h)')

	args = parser.parse_args()
	#print args
	makeSequencerMSL(args.dcrc,args.onoff,args.duration)
```

When we run like:

```
$flashandflash.py --dcrc 1 --duration 0.5
```

We get the output in the sequencer script below:

```
ODBGET "/Equipment/Tower01/Settings/DCRC1/Charge/Bias (V)[0]" Q01
ODBSET "/Equipment/Tower01/Settings/DCRC1/Charge/Bias (V)[0]" 0
ODBGET "/Equipment/Tower01/Settings/DCRC1/Charge/Bias (V)[1]" Q11
ODBSET "/Equipment/Tower01/Settings/DCRC1/Charge/Bias (V)[1]" 0
MESSAGE $Q01
MESSAGE $Q11
ODBSET "/Playground/Run sequence" "flash"
WAIT 60
ODBSET "/Playground/Run sequence" "no_flash"
ODBSET "/Equipment/Tower01/Settings/DCRC1/Charge/Bias (V)[0]" $Q01
ODBSET "/Equipment/Tower01/Settings/DCRC1/Charge/Bias (V)[1]" $Q11
```
`time 12:11`

This approach worked in that I could turn the bias on/off on one DCRC and then back to what it
was during a sequencer run.

`time 16:47`

Using the `.msi` script generated from this Python program worked for a general flashing/baking
scenario with a real experimental setup (the UMN fridge).
