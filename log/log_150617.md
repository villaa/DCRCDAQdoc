Data Catalogue and Processing K100 R53
======================================

Ok, time to get back into the data processing for the K100.  I came some distance in this when
working at Fermilab last summer, but now I have to close the loop and make the processing
automated.  Just to go over all the steps we need I'll list here:

1. copy raw data from `Vuk-01.spa.umn.edu` to `/data/chocula/`
2. copy the raw data to offsite locations like `nero`/`nerva`/`galba.stanford.edu`
3. make appropriate directory structures on `/data/chocula/`
4. process the data in one of the locations and resync with others
