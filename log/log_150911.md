Some problems with DAQ setup
============================

The setup of the DAQ at UMN for MIDAS running over the last couple days has gone pretty well, but
there are a few issues:

 1. Amy's DCRC_UI frontend to `flashandflash.py` almost works but not quite -- this should be easy
 to fix by setting some ODB variables that I forgot to do
 2. The `ZAP.py` sequencer script heats the fridge, there is evidence that it doesnt shut off the
 ZAP voltage for RevC board (or at least that's what happened once when we tried and as best we
 can guess it was because the board was RevC, but could be some other bug)
 3. That thing where in the `/Programs/` section of the ODB there is the trigger program listed as
 `triggerfe201` but starting it creates a new entry called `triggerfe2` instead of just turning
 green the entry that is there. 

Trying to take data
-------------------

I think the DAQ is set up by default for simple OR type triggering, so I'm just going to try
taking a run after checking the phonon thresholds on the ODB. 

Just found out the DAQ was heating the fridge, it was due to an aborted flash script that didn't
reset the voltages and charge enables. 

I also see that `mlogger` isn't running for some reason.  I tried to start it up in the terminal
but if failed with:

```
 Sep 11 11:23:13 2015 [Logger,ERROR] [mlogger.cxx:3435:add_event,ERROR] Cannot define event "Run transitions", hs_define_event() status 702
```

Try to restart all of MIDAS, this didn't work for `mlogger`.  I think I forgot to setup it as
mentioned in section H) of the `triumf_dcrc_installation.txt` document in the DCRC/DAQ git
repository. Let me do that:

 1. set "/Logger/Message file" "/home1/cdms_test/online/midas.log"  -- have to reqrite the prefix

 WAIT

 Actually, looking into it I do have most of these things set up in the ODB, but I don't have the
 `history/` or `elog/` directory in the `online/` directory, so I made those.  And added them to
 the `.gitignore`.

 That seemed to work!!  Logger is running, let me fire up the other stuff. 

 Did some runs -- in directory `/data/chocula/k100/midasraw/` runs 69 and 70.  On 70, tried a
 pause but that didn't seem to work. It just says "Run pause requested" and does nothing. Oh wait,
 it just took a long time -- now it went into a pause state. Now I'm resuming, and... looks to be
 running again.
