Continuing rollback tests
=========================

The following message made me want to do the MIDAS tests again, for fear that I had not recompiled
the frontend programs after switching the MIDAS versions. 

```
13:36:59.952 2015/10/12 [mhttpd,ERROR] [midas.c:9341:rpc_client_connect,ERROR] remote MIDAS version '2.' differs from local version '2.1'
```

So I'll go back through, sticking only to running on server `jiajin.spa.umn.edu` now since that
difference didn't seem to change the fact that it failed. 

Rollback to 2014/04/02 (SHA: d7d6f8c78dac961e33adb8ecfcac328cb4f229b5)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: the frontends show up green today on the front panel -- why?  Maybe this has to do with the
version recompile?

I've recompiled all the frontends.  Did the usual test and fail with the errors:

```

Did the DAQ recompile.  Errors as follows, as expected -- frontends are green on front panel.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Recompiled MIDAS.  Tried to get the frontends to show up yellow on the front page by *not*
recompiling the frontend code.  This didn't work, they still showed up green.  It might be because
there wasn't a major MIDAS revision number between the commits I'm looking at.   Maybe test that
later. 

Recompile the frontends. 

This one appears to have gotten stuck in a transition.  No useful error messages coming
out--terminating manually by using the `/Runinfo/Transition in progress` key.   This seems to have
given no actual error messages, and no frontends stopped.  We did get the confirmation inside the
`triggerfe2` code that the transitions have been set up.  *Wait* I did actually get the errors,
they were just very delayed: 

```

```

Ok, I seem to be stuck. Better email these results to Scott and company.   In the meantime I guess
I can try a transition in one of the other FEs.   I should also look very carefully at the example
`minife.c` which has this sort of transition implemented. 

More tests for transitions
==========================

Transitions on other frontends
------------------------------

I decided to try removing the transition code from `triggerfe2` and inserting similar code into
`towerfe3`.  I got the following errors upon running. 

```
12:50:36.271 2015/10/13 [mhttpd,ERROR] [midas.c:9341:rpc_client_connect,ERROR] remote MIDAS version '' differs from local version '2.1'

12:50:36.259 2015/10/13 [mhttpd,ERROR] [midas.c:3660:cm_transition_call,ERROR] cannot connect to client "towerfe3_01" on host localhost, port 11278, status 503

12:50:36.246 2015/10/13 [mhttpd,ERROR] [midas.c:9293:rpc_client_connect,ERROR] cannot connect to host "localhost", port 11278: connect() returned -1, errno 9 (Bad file descriptor)
```

The last error is disconcerting because I think the MIDAS version should be consistent.  It's not
clear what it's comparing there, and it apparently gets an empty string.   Maybe that's in the end
just an artifact of not being able to communicate with the process.   That seems plausible. 


Deferred start transition instead
---------------------------------

I decided to try to use a deferred transition on the start instead of the standard transition.
This work is in the branch `randomTest_StartDeferred` as opposed to my randoms development branch
`randomTest`.   It seems that in this mode we at least get into the running state.  We do get this
confusing error though:

```
13:41:01.162 2015/10/13 [mhttpd,ERROR] [midas.c:4444:cm_transition,ERROR] Could not start a run: cm_transition() status 110, message '(null)'
```

I'm not sure what the meaning of that is, the run started and everything appears to have "worked."  

I don't think the transition is working though, because it never prints the message I have at the
end of the transition.
